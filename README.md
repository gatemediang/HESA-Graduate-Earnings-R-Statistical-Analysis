**Principal Statistical Analyst Portfolio —  Jisc / HESA**

A rigorous, end-to-end R analysis linking graduate occupational outcomes (HESA Table 22) to salary distributions (HESA Table 26) across 229 UK higher education providers — culminating in a quantile regression model, interactive Shiny dashboard, and publication-quality outputs.

---

## 📌 The Problem

UK higher education policy lacks a provider-level evidence base that directly connects *what jobs graduates get* to *how much they earn*. HESA publishes occupational data (Table 22) and salary data (Table 26) separately — but no published analysis joins them to quantify the **graduate skills premium**: the salary uplift from placing graduates into professional and managerial roles (SOC major groups 1–3).

This project fills that gap.

## 🎯 Research Questions

1. Is there a measurable salary premium associated with higher rates of graduate-level employment at provider level?
2. Does this premium vary across the earnings distribution (i.e. is it larger for already high-earning providers)?
3. Which providers perform best and worst after controlling for national median salary?

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Salary Estimation
- Salary band midpoints used as numeric outcome (true individual salaries unavailable in published HESA data)
- Open-ended upper band (£51,000+) assigned conservative midpoint of £57,000
- **Weighted mean** = Σ(midpoint × count) ÷ Σ(count) per provider-year-mode group
- Providers with fewer than 10 graduates excluded (unreliable estimates)

### 2. Suppression Handling
- HESA suppressed cells (marked ".") excluded from all calculations
- Zero counts treated as genuine zeros (not suppressed)
- No imputation applied — missing values excluded, not filled

### 3. Population Alignment
- Table 22 filtered to **Undergraduate level** to match Table 26 scope
- Both tables restricted to: UK permanent address · full-time paid employment
- Join performed on UKPRN + year + mode

### 4. Skills Premium
- Defined as: **provider mean salary − national median salary (£22,172)**
- Positive = above national median; Negative = below
- Enables a ranked league table of all 229 providers

### 5. Quantile Regression
- **Model:** `rq(mean_salary ~ pct_graduate_role, tau = c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75))`
- **Package:** `quantreg` (Koenker, 2023)
- **Standard errors:** Bootstrap estimator, R=500 replications, seed=42
- **Confidence intervals:** 95%, two-tailed

## 📈 Key Findings

| # | Finding |
|---|---------|
| 1 | **£92 per percentage point** — For every 1pp increase in graduates entering professional/managerial roles (SOC 1–3), provider median salary increases by £92 (Q50 estimate, 95% CI: £60–£124, p<0.001) |
| 2 | **Heterogeneous returns** — The salary return is larger at the top of the distribution: Q75 estimate = £172/pp vs Q25 = £80/pp, confirming that quantile regression, not OLS, is the appropriate method |
| 3 | **£26,938 spread** — Between the lowest (£14,500, Northern School of Art) and highest (£41,438, Furness College) earning provider — a 186% range |
| 4 | **Specialist > Russell Group** — Top-premium providers are often specialist institutions (Furness College, London Institute of Banking & Finance) not traditional elite universities |
| 5 | **100% SOC 1–3 ≠ high salary** — Royal Academy of Music places 100% of graduates in professional roles yet records a −£5,672 deficit, reflecting arts sector wage norms |
| 6 | **Skill group gradient** — High Skilled: £27,635 · Medium Skilled: £22,256 · Low Skilled: £20,291 — a £7,344 (36%) gap from bottom to top |

## ⚠️ Caveats & Limitations

- **Salary midpoints approximate** — true earnings distributions are unavailable in published HESA data
- **Table 22 temporal scope** — SOC data covers 2017/18 only in the joined dataset; Table 26 spans 2017/18–2022/23
- **Not causal** — skills premium is descriptive; unobserved provider and student characteristics confound the relationship
- **Response rate variation** — see HESA Table 5 for provider-level response rates
- **Band midpoint bias** — the open-ended upper band (£51k+) assignment of £57k is conservative and may understate high earner salaries
- **15-month snapshot** — HESA Graduate Outcomes captures employment status 15 months post-graduation, not lifetime trajectories
